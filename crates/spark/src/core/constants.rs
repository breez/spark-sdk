/// Calculates the next pair of sequence numbers for transaction timelocks.
///
/// This function is used in the Spark protocol to generate decreasing timelocks
/// for refund transactions. Each call decreases the timelock by `TIME_LOCK_INTERVAL` blocks.
/// It returns both a CPFP sequence and a direct sequence, where the direct sequence
/// is offset by `DIRECT_TIME_LOCK_OFFSET` blocks from the CPFP sequence.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `current_sequence` - The current sequence number to decrement
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Some((cpfp_sequence, direct_sequence))` - A tuple containing the next CPFP and direct sequence numbers
/// * `None` - If the timelock can't be decreased further (would go below zero)
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - CPFP sequences are used for transactions that include an anchor output for fee bumping
/// - Direct sequences are used for transactions that spend directly without anchor outputs
/// - The direct sequence is always `DIRECT_TIME_LOCK_OFFSET` blocks higher than the CPFP sequence
