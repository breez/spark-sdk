## UX Guidelines

When implementing the Breez SDK, we recommend reading through our [UX Guidelines](/guide/uxguide.md) to provide a consistent and intuitive experience for your end-users.

Many of the guidelines are implemented in [Glow](https://glow-app.co), which you can use as a UX reference during SDK implementation.
