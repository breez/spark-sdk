# Getting Started

Integrating Breez SDK - Nodeless *(Spark Implementation)* into your application takes just a few minutes.

Before you begin, make sure to read the [repository README](https://github.com/breez/spark-sdk#breez-sdk---nodeless-spark-implementation) carefully. Then follow these steps to get started:

- **[Installing the SDK](/guide/install.md)**
- **[Initializing the SDK](/guide/initializing.md)**
- **[Fetching the balance](/guide/get_info.md)**
- **[Listening to events](/guide/events.md)**
- **[Adding logging](/guide/logging.md)**

## API Key

The _Nodeless_ Breez API key must be set for the SDK to work. You can request one for free by filling our form <a target="_blank" href="{{api_key_form_uri}}">here</a>.

## UX Guidelines

When implementing the Breez SDK, we recommend reading through our [UX Guidelines](/guide/uxguide.md) to provide a consistent and intuitive experience for your end-users.

Many of the guidelines are implemented in [Misty Breez](https://github.com/breez/misty-breez/), which you can use as the primary UX reference during SDK implementation.
