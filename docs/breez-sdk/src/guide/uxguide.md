# UX Guidelines

These guidelines describe how to integrate the Breez SDK to create a consistent UI/UX that feels natural for end users. They are based on [Misty Breez](https://breez.technology/misty/) patterns and are recommendations you can adapt to your specific use cases.

> **Reference:** Many of these guidelines are implemented in **Misty Breez**. Use it as the primary UX reference during SDK implementation.

## Core UX principles

- **Simplicity over choice**: users should not have to pick protocols or rails unless absolutely necessary.
- **Transparency without jargon**: show limits, fees, and conditions up front in plain language.
- **Progressive disclosure**: keep advanced details available but tucked away by default.
