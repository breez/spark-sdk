# Advanced features

The SDK supports advanced features that may be useful in specific use cases:

- **[Spark HTLC payments](htlcs.md)** enable conditional payments and are useful for implementing atomic cross-chain swaps
- **[Custom leaf optimization](optimize.md)** allows defining the leaf optimization policy and controlling when itoccurs in order to minimize payment latency
