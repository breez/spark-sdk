# Breez SDK - Nodeless *(Spark Implementation)*

## **Overview**

The Breez SDK provides developers with an end-to-end solution for integrating self-custodial Lightning into their apps and services.
It eliminates the need for third parties, simplifies the complexities of Bitcoin and Lightning, and enables seamless onboarding for billions of users to the future of value transfer.

**The Breez SDK is free for developers.**


## **What is the Breez SDK - Nodeless *(Spark Implementation)*?**

It’s a nodeless integration that offers a self-custodial, end-to-end solution for integrating Lightning, utilizing the Bitcoin-native Layer 2 Spark with on-chain interoperability. Using the SDK you'll able to:

- Send payments via various protocols such as: Bolt11, LNURL-Pay, Lightning address, BTC address, Spark address, BTKN
- Receive payments via various protocols such as: Bolt11, BTC address, Spark address, BTKN

**Key Features**
- [x] Send and receive Lightning payments
- [x] Send and receive via LNURL-pay & Lightning addresses 
- [x] Send and receive Spark payments (BTC)
- [x] Send and receive Spark tokens (BTKN)
- [x] On-chain interoperability
- [x] Bindings to all popular languages & frameworks
- [x] Keys are only held by users
- [x] Payments persistency including restore support
- [x] Automatic claims
- [x] WebAssembly support
- [x] Free open-source solution

## How Does Nodeless *(Spark Implementation)* Work?

The Breez SDK – Nodeless (*Spark implementation*) uses Spark, a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 built on a shared signing protocol, to enable real-time, low-fee, self-custodial payments.

When sending a payment, Spark delegates the transfer of on-chain bitcoin to the recipient through a multi-signature process.
Spark Operators help facilitate the transfer, but they cannot move funds without the user. This allows the payment to settle almost instantly, without requiring a blockchain confirmation.

When receiving a payment, the same process works in reverse: the network updates ownership of the bitcoin to the user through the shared signing system, recording the change off-chain while always keeping the funds secure.

Unlike blockchains, rollups, or smart contracts, Spark doesn’t create a new ledger or require trust in external consensus.
On Bitcoin’s main chain, Spark transactions appear as a series of multi-sig wallets. Off-chain, Spark keeps a lightweight record of balances and history.

Funds are self-custodial: you can exit Spark at any time and reclaim your bitcoin directly on the Bitcoin main chain.
